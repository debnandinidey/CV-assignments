    "#### 3. What is dilated convolution, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans: Dilated convolution, also known as atrous convolution, is a modification of the traditional convolution operation used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It introduces a dilation factor to the convolutional kernel, which effectively increases the receptive field of the convolutional layer without increasing the number of parameters.\n",
    "The key idea behind dilated convolution is to increase the receptive field while maintaining a relatively smaller number of parameters. By dilating the convolutional kernel, the network can gather information from a larger area without increasing the kernel size or adding more parameters. This can be beneficial in various scenarios: Increased context, Parameter efficiency, Multi-scale analysis"

    "    Transposed convolution, also known as deconvolution or fractionally-strided convolution, is an operation commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for upsampling or increasing the spatial resolution of feature maps. It is the inverse operation of standard convolution and allows the network to learn to upsample feature maps.

    "Ans:\n",
    "    Capsule networks, also known as CapsNets, are a type of neural network architecture introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues in 2017. Capsule networks aim to overcome some limitations of traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using \"capsules,\" which are groups of neurons that represent specific entities or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"capsule\" comes from the idea that these groups of neurons encapsulate the properties and attributes of a particular entity. In contrast to traditional CNNs that use scalar outputs (activations) from neurons, capsule networks use vector outputs called \"capsule activations.\" These capsule activations encode various properties, such as the presence, pose, and instantiation parameters of a specific entity."

    "    Receptive fields refer to the local regions of an input space that a neuron or a group of neurons in a neural network is sensitive to. In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), receptive fields determine the spatial extent over which a neuron in a particular layer of the network can \"see\" and gather information.
