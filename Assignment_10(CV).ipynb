    "#### 3. What is dilated convolution, and how does it work?\n",
    "Ans: Dilated convolution, also known as atrous convolution, is a modification of the traditional convolution operation used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It introduces a dilation factor to the convolutional kernel, which effectively increases the receptive field of the convolutional layer without increasing the number of parameters.\n",
    "The key idea behind dilated convolution is to increase the receptive field while maintaining a relatively smaller number of parameters. By dilating the convolutional kernel, the network can gather information from a larger area without increasing the kernel size or adding more parameters. This can be beneficial in various scenarios like Increased context, Parameter efficiency, Multi-scale analysis."

    "    Transposed convolution, also known as deconvolution or fractionally-strided convolution, is an operation commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for upsampling or increasing the spatial resolution of feature maps. It is the inverse operation of standard convolution and allows the network to learn to upsample feature maps. \n",
    "    Padding- Before applying the transposed convolution, padding is typically added to the input feature map.\n",
    "    Upsampling- Transposed convolution performs upsampling by inserting \"empty\" or zero-value spaces between the input values. These empty spaces act as placeholders for the upsampled values.\n",
    "   Input and Output Sizes: In a regular convolution, the input feature map has a certain spatial dimension (height and width), and the output feature map has a smaller spatial dimension due to the application of filters and pooling operations"

    "Ans:\n",
    "    Receptive fields refer to the local regions of an input space that a neuron or a group of neurons in a neural network is sensitive to. In the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), receptive fields determine the spatial extent over which a neuron in a particular layer of the network can \"see\" and gather information. Here's how receptive fields works: Local Receptive Fields, Convolutional Operation: During the forward pass of the network, the local receptive field is convolved with a learnab, Hierarchical Structure, Feature Hierarchy. \n",
    "    It Works like-\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution Operation: During the forward pass of the network, the local receptive field is convolved with a filter or kernel. The receptive field is slid across the input data, and at each position, element-wise multiplications are performed between the receptive field and the corresponding region of the input. These multiplications are summed to compute the activation of the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Structure: As the input data flows through subsequent layers of the network, the receptive fields of neurons become larger. This enlargement is typically achieved by pooling or striding operations, which reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. \n",
